For this assignment, I tried making a number of changes. I was unsuccesful in some of them. I first added an alert that plays when an alien reaches a certain point close to the player. It worked, but the noise it makes is unpleasant. The second change I made was to add a different type of enemy. I spawned 3 of them at a time and made these slightly faster than the original enemies. I also tried making them shoot projectiles at the player.Upon hitting the player, the game should be over. It works, but only partly. For some reason, only a couple of the rockets reach the bottom area where player is. Oftentimes, the rocket disappears slightly before reaching that point, but it does end the game if one of them lands on the player. I made it so that each of the special enemies would shoot the rocket upon coming within a certain distance of the players x coordinate. I also tried to make the speed increase as the player accumulated a higher score but that didn't work out and resulted in the enemies bunching up once they shifted down. I ended up leaving it as it was. Altogether I didn't do much but it was a cool assignment.
